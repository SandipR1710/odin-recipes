    <h1>Gulab Jamun</h1>
    <img src="../images/gulabjmn.jpeg" alt="Gulab Jamun Image">
    <p>Gulab jamun is a popular Indian sweet made from milk solids, flour, and sugar syrup. The dough is kneaded into balls and deep-fried until golden brown. These dumplings are then soaked in a rose-flavored syrup, giving them a sweet, sticky texture. They are commonly served during festivals and special occasions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Ingredients</h3></li>
        <ul>
            <p>For gulab jamun balls</p>
            <li>1 cup milk powder</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>2-3 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)</li>
            <li>2-3 tablespoons milk</li>
            <li>Oil or ghee, for deep-frying</li>
            <p>1.5 cups granulated sugar</p>
            <li>1.5 cups water</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon rose water</li>
            <li>4-5 green cardamom pods, lightly crushed</li>
        </ul>
        <li><h3>Instructions</h3></li>
        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the milk powder, all-purpose flour, and baking soda. Add ghee and mix well, using your fingers, until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
            <li>Gradually add milk, a tablespoon at a time, and knead the mixture into a soft dough. Cover the dough and let it rest for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, prepare the sugar syrup. In a saucepan, combine the sugar, water, rose water, and crushed cardamom pods. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves completely. Simmer the syrup over low heat for 5-7 minutes, until it thickens slightly. Turn off the heat and keep the syrup warm.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 12-15 equal portions and shape them into smooth balls, without any cracks.</li>
            <li>Heat oil or ghee in a deep-frying pan over medium heat. Once hot, reduce the heat to low and carefully add the dough balls to the oil. Fry them for 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they turn golden brown and evenly cooked.</li>
            <li>Remove the fried balls from the oil using a slotted spoon and transfer them to the warm sugar syrup. Let them soak in the syrup for at least 30 minutes, until they absorb the syrup and become soft and spongy.</li>
            <li>Serve the gulab jamun warm or at room temperature, garnished with chopped nuts or saffron threads, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
