    <p>Dosa is a popular South Indian crepe made from fermented rice and lentil batter. It is a thin and crispy pancake, usually served with a variety of chutneys and sambar (vegetable stew). Dosas come in many varieties, including masala dosa, onion dosa, and cheese dosa, and are enjoyed as a breakfast or snack item.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Ingredients</h3></li>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup uncooked white rice</li>
            <li>1/2 cup uncooked urad dal (white lentils)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon fenugreek seeds (optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water (plus more as needed)</li>
        </ul>
        <li><h3>Instructions</h3></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds (if using) separately in water. Soak them in enough water for at least 4 hours, or overnight.</li>
            <li>Drain the water from the rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds. Grind them in a blender or wet grinder, adding water as needed, until you have a smooth batter. The batter should be thick but pourable.</li>
            <li>Transfer the batter to a large bowl and add salt. Mix well and cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap. Let it ferment in a warm place for at least 8 hours or overnight. The batter should double in volume and develop a slightly sour smell.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or dosa pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, reduce the heat to medium-low. Spread a few drops of oil over the pan using a folded paper towel or a brush.</li>
            <li>Pour a ladleful of the dosa batter onto the center of the pan. Quickly spread the batter in a circular motion with the back of the ladle to form a thin and even layer. Drizzle some oil over the edges of the dosa.</li>
            <li>Cook the dosa until the edges turn golden brown and the surface looks cooked. Use a spatula to fold the dosa in half and transfer it to a plate.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process with the remaining batter, stirring the batter well before making each dosa.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with sambar and coconut chutney or any other chutney of your choice.</li>
        </ol>
